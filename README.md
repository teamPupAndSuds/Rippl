### getting started
To get started, you will need some API keys to make everything work.  Please get API keys for the following:
  	1. https://dev.twitter.com/
  	2. https://www.havenondemand.com/
Once you have API keys, please remove the .example from haven.example.js and twitter.example.js and add your API keys into these files.
Once you have those two files setup, run npm install to get all the required packages.
Then run npm start server to start up your local express server.  From there, run npm run dev-react to load up all of your react files.  Finally, run npm run twitterscript.
Once all these commands have been ran, navigate to localhost:3000 to use the app.  From here, you are able to get a Rippl score for any twitter user.
